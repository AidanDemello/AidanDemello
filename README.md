# Hi, I'm Aidan ðŸ˜„

Welcome to my Github profile! I am a data scientist/analyst who is currently based in Paris. With a strong passion for mathematics, science, music, sports, and exploring new horizons, I am always on the lookout for new ways to solve problems. ðŸš€

## What I'm up to
I'm currently working as a data scientist and analyst for GroupM (WPP) in an engineering department. My main focus is on creating fully automated interactive dashboards that utilize multiple DSPs (Demand Side Platform) as data sources. In addition, I am also involved in developing Google Add-ons for automation purposes, which are used by departments worldwide. I also help to build a Django app for media traders, which I believe will have a big impact on the industry. Being part of such an innovative and dynamic team has been a great experience, and I'm always striving to push the boundaries of what's possible with data. ðŸ¤–ðŸ’»ðŸ“ˆ

When I am not coding or working, you may find me writing songs or engaging in any of my other hobbies. ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¹ðŸŽ¾

## Get in touch
